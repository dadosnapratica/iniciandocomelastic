# Get Started with Elastic

Learn the basics and learn how to get started by building an Elastic cluster.

This is a repository for Kataconda-hosted Interactive Training - Getting Started with Elastic.

# Use of KataCoda

This repository was originally designed to utilize KataCoda, a powerful platform for creating interactive learning environments. KataCoda allowed developers to build, share, and explore hands-on tutorials directly in the browser, empowering teams and individuals to learn new technologies in an immersive way.

## About KataCoda

KataCoda was a unique solution for creating interactive learning environments for technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud-native tools. It became widely adopted in the software development and DevOps communities for its simplicity and effectiveness.

However, after KataCoda was acquired by O'Reilly Media, the company made the unfortunate decision to shut down the platform on **May 16, 2022**. The shutdown has left a gap in the ecosystem of interactive training tools for developers and technologists.

You can find more information about the closure of KataCoda on O'Reilly's official communication:
